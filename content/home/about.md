# Biography

I am an economist at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) within the Centre for Data Exploitation (CoDE). My research interests lie primarily within macroeconomics, specifically the areas of monetary economics, search and matching models and housing markets. Outside of economics, I enjoy music, the New England Patriots and long haired daschunds.
