abstract = "There is a wealth of evidence which suggests that anticipated shocks are an important source of macroeconomic fluctuations, but many standard models cannot reproduce the response of economic activity found in much of this empirical work. First, I show by using a local projection method that there are also significant responses of labour market aggregates to identified news shocks and that they can explain a substantial proportion of the fluctuations present in these variables. Next, I embed anticipated shocks into a search and matching model with capital and ascertain that the calibrated model can generate responses which are extremely similar to those from the estimated impulse response functions, primarily via the forward-looking vacancy posting Euler equation. The presence of TFP news shocks can also increase the persistence in vacancies, which is too low in standard search and matching models. I find that both the empirical and theoretical results are robust to a number of extensions and modifications, although alternative calibrations of the model lead to the disappearance of any news shock dynamics. Ultimately, anticipated shocks seem to be of high importance to the labour market."
